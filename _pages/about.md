Welcome to Zhen Xiang's homepage!

I am a postdoc affiliated with the Secure Learning Lab (SLL) led by [Prof Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I received my B.E. in Electronics and Computer Engineering from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2014, my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), and my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) supervised by [Prof David J. Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0AvzzVoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof George Kesidis](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/) in 2022.

I work on trustworthy machine learning, with the main focus on backdoor attacks and defenses. My long-term goal is to develop theory-based defense approaches and security standards for safety-sensitive applications.

**I will be on the job market 2023/2024!**
